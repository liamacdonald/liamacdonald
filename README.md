Welcome to my profile!

My main focus is Data Engineering, specifically building data pipelines using multiple cloud applications.  I have intermediate knowledge in Python and SQL and I've been working recently to grow my knowledge in more infrastructure related concepts such as general use of AWS and understanding the creation and use of Docker Containers.  

My background is in economics and over the past couple of years have slowly be transitioning into Data Engineering.  I was originally attracted to economics through an interest in applications of advanced mathematics to real world problems and saw a greater future in the software world than academic econ leading to my current position.  My focus is on Data Engineering right now but have an interest in growing my knowledge in Software Engineering as I get more comfortable in Software Development.
